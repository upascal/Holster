## What It Does

Holster sits quietly in your menu bar displaying the icon of your chosen app. One click shows or hides that app — perfect for apps you frequently toggle like Claude, Spotify, Messages, Slack, or even Adobe tools.

**Think of it as a quick-draw holster for your favorite app.**

## Features

- **One-click toggle** — Left-click to show/hide your holstered app
- **Native app icon** — Menu bar shows the actual icon of your chosen app
- **Lightweight** — Runs as a pure menu bar app (no Dock icon)
- **Simple setup** — Right-click to choose or change your target app
- **Remembers your choice** — Settings persist between launches
